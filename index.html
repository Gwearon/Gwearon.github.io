        <h2>Fee</h2>
        <p>
            Our current fee is <strong>1%</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Stake pool</h2>
        <p>
            Our stake pool is <strong>LIVE</strong>. ID of the pool is 54b1cbd5a704dc062756e15f3b4828fd31e761a35acf009eaf235e1a12d86992. We suggest to wait till the next week when you will be able to delegate through official <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io" target="_blank">Daedalus wallet</a>, incentivezed testnet version.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to guide our users to <strong>securely</strong> delegate their ADA and get their <strong>staking rewards</strong>. With this in mind we will try to optimise other parameters to enable the most savings to be passed on to our users. We also spread knowledge about the whole Cardano ecosystem.
        </p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>
            ADA Point Pool staking node will go online as soon as <strong>IOHK</strong> will ship a public version of the node software for the <strong>Cardano</strong> network. First staking network - <a href="https://staking.cardano.org" target="_blank">incentivezed testnet</a> should go live on 16 December 2019. Our "Incentivized testnet" node is already <strong>live</strong>. We were running a beta version of the node (nightly build) before for server testing purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>What is staking?</h2>
        <p>
            Staking or delegation is the process where ADA holders delegate the stake of their ADA to a <strong>stake pool</strong>. It enables ADA holders who do not have the skills or desire to run a full node to be part of the network and be <strong>rewarded</strong> proportionally based on the amount of stake that is delegated. <br /><br /> There is <strong>NO security risk</strong> for the user as you are not sending any funds to our pool, just delegating your account.
        </p>
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>
            Our cloud servers are currently in <strong>Germany, Europe</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            Our servers are virtualized and hardware is added <strong>only</strong> on a need to basis. Therefore we can pass all the  <strong>savings</strong> on to our users. Because of virtualization if the need arises for a different location or upgraded hardware we can quickly do that without downtime.
        </p>
        <h2>Staking calculations</h2>
        <p>
            You can calculate how much ADA you will get with the official <a href="https://staking.cardano.org/en/calculator" target="_blank">Cardano stake calculator</a>.
