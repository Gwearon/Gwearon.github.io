            <h3>Epoch 211</h3><br />
            <p>
            This was the first epoch for all pools and for <strong>Ada Point Pool</strong>.<br/><br/>
            We were really successful as we mined <strong>5 blocks</strong> at active delegated stake of 12 million ADA ⛏<br/><br/>
            Comparing that to saturated pools with the most delegates - they had about 40 blocks and 195 million ADA delegated. If they have had the same block ratio as Ada Point Pool they would have created around 80 blocks!! (195 / 12 * 5) That should/will translate into better rewards for our users. <br/><br/>
            First <strong>rewards distribution</strong> will happen at the end of this epoch (23th August). <br/><br/>
            Our pool size increased to <strong>19.2 million ADA</strong> and we have already created the first block in Epoch 212. 🙌🎉

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            Our servers are currently in <strong>Germany, Europe</strong>. <br /><br />

            The servers are virtualized and hardware is added <strong>only</strong> on a need to basis. Therefore we can pass all the  <strong>savings</strong> on to our users. Because of virtualization if the need arises for a different location or upgraded hardware we can quickly do that without any downtime.
        <p>
        <ul class="features">
            <li>uptime of <strong>99.99%</strong></li>
            <li>monitoring tools <strong>24/7</strong></li>
            <li><strong>DIN ISO / IEC 27001 certification</strong> for information security for IT systems</li>
            <li>failsafe procedures</li>
            <li>firewall</li>
            <li>virtualized environment</li>
            <li>industry standard hardened linux server distribution</li>
            <li>disk encryption</li>
            <li>automatic backups</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
            We provide <strong>transparency</strong> so our users see what we do and we also help other pool operators or future pool operators to learn something new and further improve their pools.

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of professionals with decades of programming experience. We are interested in functional programming, web programming and science in general.
        </p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>First staking network - <a rel="noopener" href="https://staking.cardano.org" target="_blank">incentivezed testnet</a> went live 16 December, 2019. Our "Incentivized testnet" APP node has been live <strong>live</strong> from 15 December, 2019. We were running a beta version of the node (nightly build) before for server testing purposes. </p>
        <p>APP has created more than <strong>3,000+ blocks</strong> on the ITN network and distributed <strong>2,500,000+ million ADA</strong> among our users. The combined delegated stake to our pool is over <strong>6 billion+ ADA</strong>.</p>
        <p>Our Cardano Shelley pool is live from the start.</p>
        <h2>What is staking?</h2>
        <p>
            Staking is a process where ADA holders delegate their ADA to a <strong>staking pool</strong>. It enables ADA holders who do not have the skills or desire to run a full node to be part of the network and be <strong>rewarded</strong> proportionally based on the amount of staking that is delegated. <br /><br /> There is <strong>NO security risk</strong> for the user as you are not sending any funds to our pool, just delegating your account.
        </p>
        <h2>Staking calculations</h2>
        <p>
            You can calculate how much ADA you will get with the official <a rel="noopener" href="https://staking.cardano.org/en/calculator" target="_blank">Cardano staking calculator</a>.
